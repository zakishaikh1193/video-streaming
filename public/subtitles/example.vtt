Hello, welcome to this video tutorial.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Today we will learn about automatic subtitle generation.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is powered by Whisper.cpp, a local speech recognition model.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The subtitles are generated automatically from the video's audio track.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You can use these subtitles to improve accessibility and user experience.
