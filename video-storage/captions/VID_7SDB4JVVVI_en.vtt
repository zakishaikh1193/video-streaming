Hi friends! Have you ever looked around and thought about the land we live on? Let's

00:09.720 --> 00:15.280
go on a fun adventure to explore some of the amazing features of the United Arab Emirates,

00:15.280 --> 00:22.480
like deserts, mountains, coastlines, islands, and oasis. These are called landforms and each

00:22.480 --> 00:29.600
one is truly unique and special. Most of the UAE is covered by deserts. One of the

00:29.600 --> 00:35.440
most famous deserts here is the Al-Badaya Desert, known for its tall sand dunes and fun activities

00:35.440 --> 00:41.120
like dune bashing and camel rides. Deserts may seem empty at first, but they're full of life,

00:41.120 --> 00:46.880
plants, animals, and even people who have lived here for a long, long time. Isn't that amazing?

00:48.080 --> 00:54.160
Now, let's climb up high to the mountains. The UAE has tall rocky mountains, especially in the

00:54.160 --> 01:00.560
north. Jabel Jai's part of the Hajar Mountains is the highest mountain in the UAE. It's a great

01:00.560 --> 01:07.360
place to feel the cool breeze, go hiking, and even see snow and winter. Next, let's visit the

01:07.360 --> 01:14.400
coastlines. The UAE has long coastlines along the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. These areas

01:14.400 --> 01:20.640
are full of sea life and are important for fishing, travel, and trade. People love to walk along the

01:20.640 --> 01:28.160
Corniche, swim in the sea, and have picnics by the beach. And look at this, a beautiful oasis.

01:28.160 --> 01:34.480
Oasis are special places in the desert where you find water, trees, and animals. The Lila Oasis

01:34.480 --> 01:39.920
in Abu Dhabi is one of the biggest in the UAE. It gives life to the desert and helps people

01:39.920 --> 01:47.520
grow dates and other fruits. Wasn't that a wonderful journey? The land around us is full of wonders,

01:47.520 --> 01:54.720
and now you know so much more about the UAE's amazing landforms.
