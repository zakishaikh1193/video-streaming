00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Connecting with the world.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.240
Hi, everyone. We're talking about how the world is connected through technology,

00:08.240 --> 00:13.280
travel, and communication. These three things bring people closer together,

00:13.280 --> 00:16.160
helping us learn, share, and understand each other.

00:17.840 --> 00:21.280
Let's explore how they make the world feel like one big community.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.680
Technology makes it easy to connect with people around the world.

00:26.320 --> 00:29.600
In the past, letters took weeks to travel between countries,

00:29.600 --> 00:34.960
but now we can use video calls, emails, and social media to stay in touch instantly.

00:37.040 --> 00:42.320
Travel connects people by allowing us to experience new foods, languages, and traditions,

00:42.800 --> 00:46.720
while visitors to the UAE enjoy its hospitality and celebrations.

00:47.680 --> 00:52.880
Communication builds global friendships, with tools like translators helping us share cultures

00:52.880 --> 00:58.560
and understand each other better. Together, travel and communication break barriers and

00:58.560 --> 01:04.160
bring the world closer. When we interact with people from other cultures,

01:04.160 --> 01:06.480
it's important to be respectful and open-minded.

01:07.520 --> 01:13.440
In Islam, generosity and kindness are important values, and welcoming others build strong

01:13.440 --> 01:19.280
relationships. By appreciating different traditions, we make the world a friendlier place for everyone.

01:20.480 --> 01:25.200
Technology, travel, and communication have transformed how we connect with the world.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.560
By using these tools with respect and kindness, we can learn, share, and build a more united

01:32.560 --> 01:40.560
and understanding global community.
