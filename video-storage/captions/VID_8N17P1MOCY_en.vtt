Hi everyone, let's go on an exciting journey to learn about festivals and traditions in the

00:09.400 --> 00:12.000
Gulf region.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.320
Festivals are special times when families and communities come together to celebrate.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.960
They bring happiness, teach us about our culture, and help us stay connected.

00:20.960 --> 00:25.520
Let us dive into some of the most amazing festivals in the Gulf.

00:25.520 --> 00:29.680
First, we have Edelfeiter.

00:29.680 --> 00:34.760
After the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims celebrate Edelfeiter.

00:34.760 --> 00:40.360
Families get together, enjoy yummy dishes like kabsah and sweets like mamul, and share

00:40.360 --> 00:43.360
with those in need through charity called Zakat al-Fitr.

00:43.360 --> 00:48.080
It's all about being thankful and spreading joy.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.800
Another important festival is Edel-Ada.

00:50.800 --> 00:55.080
It happens after the Hodge Pilgrimage, where Muslims from all over the world visit the

00:55.080 --> 00:58.160
Holy City of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.

00:58.160 --> 01:02.560
Families share meals and donate food to help others, remembering Prophet Ibrahim's story

01:02.560 --> 01:03.560
of faith.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.800
Edel-Ada teaches us about kindness and helping others.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.840
Now let's talk about national days in the Gulf.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.480
Every year, each Gulf country celebrates its own national day.

01:15.480 --> 01:22.000
For example, the UAE on December 2nd, Oman on November 18th, and Qatar on December 18th.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.320
There are fireworks, music, and parades, and the cities are decorated in the colors of

01:27.320 --> 01:28.320
the national flag.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.920
It's a day to feel proud and happy.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.920
Did you know there are also regional festivals?

01:34.920 --> 01:40.200
In parts of the Gulf, there's the Rose Festival in spring, where beautiful Damascus roses

01:40.200 --> 01:42.360
are turned into perfumes.

01:42.360 --> 01:47.120
In date-growing regions of the Gulf, there's the dates festival, celebrating one of the most

01:47.120 --> 01:49.400
important fruits in the region.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.880
And in the southern mountain areas like Do Far and Oman, there's the Kareep Festival,

01:53.880 --> 01:56.800
with amazing dances and handmade crafts.

01:56.800 --> 02:01.600
The Gulf's festivals are like colorful threads in a beautiful tapestry, weaving together

02:01.600 --> 02:04.360
history, culture, and faith.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.360
They remind us to celebrate-
