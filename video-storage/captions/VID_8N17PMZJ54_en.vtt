Hi friends, welcome to another adventure in learning. Today we're exploring our amazing

00:10.860 --> 00:16.860
planet Earth. Did you know Earth has two big features? Continence and oceans? Let's dive

00:16.860 --> 00:18.460
in!

00:18.460 --> 00:24.780
First, let's talk about continents. Continence are giant pieces of land where people, animals

00:24.780 --> 00:29.780
and plants live. Earth has seven continents. Let's meet them.

00:29.780 --> 00:36.780
Asia. The biggest and most populated continent, home to the tallest mountain Mount Everest.

00:36.780 --> 00:44.300
Africa. Known for its amazing animals, the Sahara Desert, and the Nile River, the longest

00:44.300 --> 00:51.400
river in the world. Europe. Famous for its rich history, art, and landmarks like the

00:51.400 --> 00:59.320
Eiffel Tower. North America. Home to the Grand Canyon and Great Lakes. It's where

00:59.320 --> 01:06.080
countries like the United States and Canada are. South America. Known for the Amazon

01:06.080 --> 01:13.960
rainforest and the Andes Mountains. Australia. Both a continent and a country. It's

01:13.960 --> 01:21.040
home to kangaroos and the Great Barrier Reef. Antarctica. The coldest continent. Covered

01:21.040 --> 01:25.960
in ice with penguins as its coolest residents.

01:25.960 --> 01:31.160
Now let's explore the oceans. Oceans are huge, salty bodies of water that cover most of

01:31.160 --> 01:38.400
Earth's surface. There are five major oceans. Let's make a splash.

01:38.400 --> 01:45.440
Pacific Ocean. The biggest and deepest ocean. Full of islands like Hawaii.

01:45.440 --> 01:50.560
Atlantic Ocean separates the Americas from Europe and Africa. It's a highway for ships

01:50.560 --> 01:58.480
and trade. Indian Ocean. Warm waters between Africa, Asia and Australia. Great for fishing

01:58.480 --> 02:08.280
and trade. Southern Ocean. Circles icy Antarctica and helps cool our planet. Arctic Ocean.

02:08.280 --> 02:14.080
The smallest and coldest ocean. Home to polar bears and seals.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.640
Did you know the continents and oceans connect us all? Countries connect though oceans

02:18.640 --> 02:25.360
to travel, trade and share ideas. That's called global interdependence. It means we all

02:25.360 --> 02:31.960
work together like a big team. When we help each other, like sharing food, knowledge and

02:31.960 --> 02:38.360
solving problems like climate change, we make Earth a better place for everyone.

02:38.360 --> 02:44.280
So remember the seven continents and five oceans make up our amazing world. Each one is

02:44.280 --> 02:47.760
unique, but together they make Earth our home.
