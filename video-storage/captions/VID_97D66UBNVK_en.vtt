00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
The role of international organizations.

00:03.040 --> 00:07.920
Hi, everyone. We're exploring the role of international organizations,

00:07.920 --> 00:12.400
groups that bring countries together to solve global challenges and create a

00:12.400 --> 00:13.240
better future.

00:13.240 --> 00:16.440
What are international organizations?

00:16.440 --> 00:20.200
One of the most prominent organizations is the United Nations,

00:20.200 --> 00:24.360
UN, established in 1945 to promote

00:24.360 --> 00:29.120
global peace and cooperation among its 193 member states.

00:29.920 --> 00:35.280
It addresses key challenges such as security, development, and humanitarian aid

00:35.280 --> 00:40.200
through its main bodies, including the General Assembly and Security Council.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.640
Many member countries support UN initiatives, including Refugee Aid,

00:44.640 --> 00:47.280
Peacekeeping, and Climate Efforts.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.280
Notable contributions have included supporting the World Food Program,

00:51.280 --> 00:53.600
hosting regional development forums,

00:53.600 --> 00:57.760
and aiding international conflict resolution.

00:57.760 --> 01:03.040
Regional cooperation with the OIC and GCC regional organizations

01:03.040 --> 01:04.720
also play a crucial role.

01:04.720 --> 01:10.320
The organization of Islamic cooperation, OIC, founded in 1969,

01:10.320 --> 01:16.400
unites 57 Muslim-majority nations to protect Islamic values.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.600
Member states lead key initiatives in education,

01:19.600 --> 01:23.200
healthcare, and conflict resolution.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.800
Similarly, the Gulf Cooperation Council, GCC,

01:26.800 --> 01:28.800
established in 1981,

01:28.800 --> 01:34.800
connects six Gulf nations to strengthen trade, security, and collaboration.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.800
Other international organizations,

01:36.800 --> 01:42.400
such as the WTO, WHO, IMF, and Arab League,

01:42.400 --> 01:45.040
further highlight global collaboration,

01:45.040 --> 01:48.240
they address issues ranging from trade and health,

01:48.240 --> 01:50.720
to finance, and regional unity,

01:50.720 --> 01:53.360
emphasizing the interconnectedness of the world

01:53.360 --> 01:56.400
and the importance of cooperation.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.920
Conclusion.

01:57.920 --> 02:02.720
Active participation in these organizations reflects a dedication to stability,

02:02.720 --> 02:05.200
shared values, and regional growth,

02:05.200 --> 02:08.560
demonstrating how international relations shape a better,

02:08.560 --> 02:10.800
more inclusive future.
