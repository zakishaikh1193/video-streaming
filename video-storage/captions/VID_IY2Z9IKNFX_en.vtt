Hi friends! Welcome to another adventure in learning. Today we're exploring our amazing

00:09.940 --> 00:15.860
planet Earth. Did you know Earth has two big features? Continence and oceans? Let's dive

00:15.860 --> 00:21.340
in! First, let's talk about continents. Continence

00:21.340 --> 00:27.660
are giant pieces of land where people, animals, and plants live. Earth has seven continents.

00:27.660 --> 00:34.020
Let's meet them. Asia. The biggest and most populated continent, home to the tallest

00:34.020 --> 00:41.340
mountain Mount Everest. Africa, known for its amazing animals, the Sahara desert, and

00:41.340 --> 00:49.540
the Nile River, the longest river in the world. Europe, famous for its rich history, art,

00:49.540 --> 00:56.900
and landmarks like the Eiffel Tower. North America, home to the Grand Canyon and

00:56.900 --> 01:04.220
Great Lakes. It's where countries like the United States and Canada are. South America,

01:04.220 --> 01:11.620
known for the Amazon rainforest and the Andes Mountains. Australia, both a continent and

01:11.620 --> 01:20.100
a country, it's home to kangaroos and the Great Barrier Reef. Antarctica, the coldest continent,

01:20.100 --> 01:25.060
covered in ice with penguins as its coolest residents.

01:25.060 --> 01:30.180
Now let's explore the oceans. Oceans are huge, salty bodies of water that cover most

01:30.180 --> 01:38.740
of Earth's surface. There are five major oceans. Let's make a splash. Pacific Ocean, the

01:38.740 --> 01:46.220
biggest and deepest ocean, full of islands like Hawaii. Atlantic Ocean, separates the

01:46.220 --> 01:53.260
Americas from Europe and Africa. It's a highway for ships and trade. Indian Ocean,

01:53.260 --> 02:01.740
storm waters between Africa, Asia and Australia. Great for fishing and trade. Southern Ocean,

02:01.740 --> 02:08.900
circles icy Antarctica and helps cool our planet. Arctic Ocean, the smallest and coldest

02:08.900 --> 02:15.140
ocean, home to polar bears and seals. Did you know the continents and oceans connect

02:15.140 --> 02:21.740
us all? Countries connect though oceans to travel, trade, and share ideas. That's called

02:21.740 --> 02:28.140
global interdependence. It means we all work together, like a big team. When we help each

02:28.140 --> 02:33.980
other, like sharing food, knowledge, and solving problems like climate change, we make Earth

02:33.980 --> 02:41.340
a better place for everyone. So remember, the seven continents and five oceans make up our

02:41.340 --> 02:46.820
amazing world. Each one is unique. But together, they make Earth our home.
