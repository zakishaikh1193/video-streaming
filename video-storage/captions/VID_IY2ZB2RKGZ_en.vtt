Saudi Arabia's role in the global economy.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.500
Hello, everyone.

00:04.500 --> 00:09.000
Did you know that one discovery changed Saudi Arabia forever?

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Before the 1930s, it was a quiet desert economy.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
But after oil was found, it transformed into a global energy leader.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Let's learn how this happened and what the country is doing to plan for the future.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Back in the early 20th century, Saudi Arabia's economy

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
relied on farming and welcoming pilgrims to holy sites.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Then, in 1938, something incredible happened.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Oil was discovered.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
The first major oil well, called Damom number 7,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
produced over 1,500 barrels of oil a day.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
That's like finding a huge treasure chest underground.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
This oil wealth allowed Saudi Arabia to build modern cities,

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
improve health care, and expand education.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Places like Riyadh grew into bustling hubs of activity.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
In 1960, Saudi Arabia joined an important group called OPEC,

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
helping to shape global oil markets.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
This gave the country a strong voice in energy discussions worldwide.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Oil has been great for Saudi Arabia, but it's not endless.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
And using too much can harm the environment.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
That's why the country is working hard to manage its resources wisely.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Saudi Arabia is using carbon capture to reduce pollution,

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
investing in clean energy projects like solar power,

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
participating in global efforts like the Paris Accord

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
to address climate change.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
These steps help balance economic growth with caring for the planet.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Saudi Arabia, recognizing it can't rely on oil forever,

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
has launched Vision 2030 to create opportunities in jobs,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
tourism, and technology.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Key initiatives include building tourist destinations,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
like the Red Sea Project and cultural sites like Durya Gate,

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
investing in renewable energy with projects like the King of Dola Solar Park,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
and launching the Saudi Green Initiative,

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
which aims to plant 10 billion trees and combat desertification.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
This ambitious plan follows the country's remarkable journey

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
from a farming economy to a global energy leader,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
paving the way for a sustainable future.
