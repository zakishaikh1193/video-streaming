Hi there, friends.

00:05.760 --> 00:10.000
Today we're going on an exciting journey across the land of Saudi Arabia.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.280
Let's explore the amazing places and natural treasures that make it so special.

00:15.280 --> 00:20.240
First, we have the rub al-Kali, or the empty quarter.

00:20.240 --> 00:25.320
It's one of the largest sand deserts in the world, with dunes as tall as buildings.

00:25.320 --> 00:29.760
Even though it's really hot and dry, it holds something super important.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.160
Oil!

00:31.160 --> 00:35.600
This oil helps Saudi Arabia make money and create jobs.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.680
Now, let's visit the Sarawat Mountains.

00:39.680 --> 00:43.080
These mountains have cooler weather and get more rain.

00:43.080 --> 00:45.520
That's why people grow crops here using terrace farming.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.280
It's like planting on giant steps.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.480
Isn't that cool?

00:50.480 --> 00:54.480
Next stop, the Red Sea coastline.

00:54.480 --> 00:59.720
This area is great for fishing, shipping, and even fun activities like diving.

01:00.400 --> 01:05.920
Did you know it has colorful coral reefs that attract visitors from all over the world?

01:05.920 --> 01:10.840
Courts here are also super busy with goods coming in and going out.

01:10.840 --> 01:16.480
Saudi Arabia doesn't have many rivers or lakes, so how do people get water?

01:16.480 --> 01:22.520
They use aquifers, underground water, and special machines called desalination plants

01:22.520 --> 01:25.720
that turn salty sea water into fresh water.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.920
Isn't science amazing?

01:28.920 --> 01:33.720
Last but not the least, Saudi Arabia's famous for oil.

01:33.720 --> 01:39.440
Oil is like a treasure underground, and it helps build cities, schools, and roads.

01:39.440 --> 01:44.520
In some places like Assir, people also grow crops like coffee and wheat.

01:44.520 --> 01:48.160
Farming and oil together help the country grow.

01:48.160 --> 01:54.400
From deserts and mountains to oceans and farms, every part of Saudi Arabia is special.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.600
Its natural resources help people live and work.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.960
Thanks for exploring with me.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.720
See you next time for more adventures.
